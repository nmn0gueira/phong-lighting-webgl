# Phong Lighting and Shading in WebGL

This project is a WebGL-based application that visualizes 3D objects under Phong lighting. It implements Phong illumination at the fragment level and allows real-time manipulation of lights, materials, and the camera.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
   
2. **Open the project folder** in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Install the Live Server extension** in Visual Studio Code if you haven't already.

4. **Start the Live Server**:
- Right-click on the `index.html` file in the file explorer and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- Alternatively, click the **Go Live** button in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window to start the server.

## Controls
